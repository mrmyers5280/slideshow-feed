# slideshow-feed
A slideshow of Instagram images based on a user-supplied hashtag for an API assignment for Thinkful's FEWD course.
The slideshow-feed uses the Instagram API to search for images tagged with a user-supplied tag, display them as a 
slideshow with a short delay between images, and play a sound from Soundcloud using the Soundcloud API.
